<h1> Credit Risk Evaluator <br> (Supervised Machine Learning Demonstration) </h1>

#### Overview:
This project examines the performance of two Supervised Learning Models: the Logistic Regression Model and the Random Forest Classifier.<br>
Both models use the lending data contained in the files indicated below for training and testing.<br>
The models first uses unscaled versions of the data and then the process is repeated with scaled versions of the data.<br>
All code and output are contained in the Jupyter notebook: *"Credit Risk Evaluator.ipynb"*.<br>
Predictions and conclusions about the accuracy of these two models are also contained within the notebook.

To examine the data and code files, their locations are indicated in the tree below.

#### Files/Folders:

+ *"Credit Risk Evaluator.ipynb"* (program for modeling the loan data and comparing the different models' performance)
+ **"Resources"** (this folder contains the data files used by *"Credit Risk Evaluator.ipynb"*) <br>
	- *"2019loans.csv"* (file containing training data) <br>
	- *"2020Q1loans.csv"* (file containing testing data) <br>
	- **"Generator"** (subfolder) <br>
		- *"GenerateData - Run First.ipynb"* (notebook to unzip the files below and create the data files) <br>
